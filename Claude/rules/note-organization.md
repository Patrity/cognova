# Note Organization

## File Naming

Use lowercase with hyphens:
- `project-ideas.md` not `Project Ideas.md`
- `meeting-notes-2024-01.md` for dated content

## Folder Structure

Organize by topic or area of responsibility:
```
vault/
├── projects/       # Active projects
├── areas/          # Ongoing responsibilities
├── resources/      # Reference material
├── archive/        # Completed/inactive
└── inbox/          # Uncategorized captures
```

## When Creating Notes

1. Check if a related note already exists
2. Place in appropriate folder
3. Add frontmatter with required fields
4. Link to related notes

## When to Split Notes

Split a note when:
- It exceeds ~500 lines
- It covers multiple distinct topics
- Sections could be referenced independently
