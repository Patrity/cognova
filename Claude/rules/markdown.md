# Markdown Formatting

## Headers

Use headers hierarchically:
- `#` for document title (one per file)
- `##` for major sections
- `###` for subsections

## Lists

- Use `-` for unordered lists
- Use `1.` for ordered/sequential steps
- Use `- [ ]` for action items within notes

## Links

Prefer wiki-style links for internal references:
```markdown
See [[project-name]] for details
Related: [[topic/subtopic]]
```

Use standard markdown for external links:
```markdown
[Display Text](https://example.com)
```

## Code

Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers:
```markdown
```python
def example():
    pass
```
```

## Emphasis

- `**bold**` for important terms
- `*italic*` for emphasis or book/article titles
- `==highlight==` for key takeaways (if supported)
